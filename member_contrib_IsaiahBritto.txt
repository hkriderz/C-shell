Design: Constructed initial layout for running the shell including the basic methods for taking the user input and handing it correctly.

Functionality: Commands:
		   - cd
		   - pwd
		   - ls
		   - exit
		   - exec
		   - help

Testing: I tested my commands a few times with various inputs. I also tested the commands that were done by my partner to make sure everything was looking good.

Overall: I combined the code on my end from what I had and inserted the functionality of the other commands that were supplied by my partner. I also helped write the report.
